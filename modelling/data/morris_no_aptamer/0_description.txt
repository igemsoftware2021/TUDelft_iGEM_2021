Morris sensitivity analysis for the prokaryotic system without aptamers,
using fifteen trajectories and four levels. The concentration of the product 
was taken as output variable.
Eleven parameters were varied, ranges were 0.3 - 3 times the following values: 

k_ts = 6.7*10**-5      # (0)  Transcription rate [uM/s]
k_tl = 7.2*10**-5      # (1)  Enzyme translation rate [uM/s]
k_mat = 0.5*10**-3     # (2)  Maturation rate of beta-galactosidase [1/s]
k_cat = 5.14*10**1     # (3)  Catalytic rate of beta-galactosidase [1/s]
k_s = 8.5*10**-3       # (4)  Michaelis constant of transcription [μM]
kc_s = 1.8*10**-4      # (5)  Scaling factor for the transcription resources [-]
k_l = 65.8*10**-3      # (6)  Michaelis constant of translation [μM]
k_tlr = 6*10**-5       # (7) Michaelis constant of translation resources [-]
k_m = 50               # (8) Michaelis constant of beta-galactosidase [μM]
deg_mrna = 1.3*10**-5  # (9) Degradation rate of mRNA [1/s]
deg_tlr = 7.5*10**-5   # (10) Degradation rate of translation resources [1/s]

Initial concentrations were:
dna_i = 5*10**-3  # Initial concentration of the beta-galactosidase gene [μM]
s_i = 1   # Initial substrate concentration [μM]

Timesteps of 1 s were used, total time was 3600.
